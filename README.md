Plans for the future:

**Lipinski:**
 - Bugfixes
 - Pawlenty tree? (Also rethink replacing Pawlenty with someone more appropriate - Ben Nelson?)
 - Lipinski independent tree
 - Lipinski-McCain coalition tree
 - Flesh out custom endings

**McCain:**
 - Total rewrite of most questions
 - Custom endings
 - New questions: electoral reform, maybe responses to incidents referenced in Lipinski side
 - Similar VONC mechanic - replacement with Snowe, Kasich, or Gregoire
 - Independent Whig defector - Moulton, Romney?
 - Subtree to get Democrats in coalition - possible combined with proviking Lipinski VONC?

**General**
 - More references to history to flesh out timeline
 - Reference pols who died IRL - Wellstone?

**Graphics**
 - Banner/custom theme
 - Song player?
