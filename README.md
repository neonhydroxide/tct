Plans for the future:

**Lipinski:**
 - Bugfixes
 - Fix number of EVs to address possible tie (163-163 apparently possible)
 - Ending question northeast boost fix
 - Add gregoire tag to the Cheney question
 - "Couple of other very minor bugs I noticed as well (both issue scores so I could be wrong), calling for Cheney to resign should probably be a plus to Social score instead of a minus and going Nimby should be a minus to Econ instead of a plus"
 - Pawlenty tree? (Also rethink replacing Pawlenty with someone more appropriate - Ben Nelson?)
 - Possibly replace cliched 2016 primary reference
 - Lipinski independent tree
 - Lipinski-McCain coalition tree
 - Flesh out custom endings - incl new ending for merged party (so it doesn't act like democrats vanish from the face of the earth)

**McCain:**
 - Total rewrite of most questions
 - Custom endings
 - New questions: electoral reform, maybe responses to incidents referenced in Lipinski side
 - Similar VONC mechanic - replacement with Snowe, Kasich, or Gregoire (also replace Kasich with less known politician)
 - Independent Whig defector - Moulton, Romney?
 - Subtree to get Democrats in coalition - possible combined with proviking Lipinski VONC?

**General**
 - More references to history to flesh out timeline
 - Issue descriptions
 - Reference pols who died IRL - Wellstone?
 - 2019 followup? Or prequel? Eg 1859/64 as 1860 parallel
 - Kennedys?
 - Canonical results (do results box for further reading
 - 

**Graphics**
 - Banner/custom theme
 - Song player?
