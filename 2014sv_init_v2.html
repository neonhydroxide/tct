With much of the party leadership stepping aside from a race they see as already lost, the Whigs have nominated maverick Senator John McCain in an attempt to shake up the status quo.</p><p>McCain looks to find a novel strategy which can peel off a part of Lipinski's broad coalition, while Lipinski seeks to reconcile varying interests to hold his fraying party and its narrow majority together.<br><br><button onclick='next0()'>History and Background</button></p></span><span id='screen1' style='display: none;'><p>The Constitutional Convention of 1787 saw a compromise between reformist and Southern states, leading to a powerful, unicameral legislature which disproportionately empowered the populous and agrarian slave states. After winning wars with Great Britain and Mexico, the new country spread across the continent, plagued throughout by internal debate over slavery. <br><br> In the late 1860s, Whig-controlled abolitionist Northern states seceded from the Union, precipitating a long civil war ending in complete dominance of the South and the Democratic Party over the country.<br><br><button onclick='back0()'>Back</button><button onclick='next1()'>More</button></p></p></span><span id='screen2' style='display: none;'><p>While the Northern states were disenfranchised under occupation, the People's Party grew out of the Western farmer and labor movements to become the main opposition to the Democrats in the late 19th century. As Northern states returned to the Union, they overwhelmingly voted for Whigs. This three-party structure ended with the collapse of the Democrats in the early 20th century.<br><br>Dominant through much of the late 1900s due in part to high international tensions, the Whigs declined again after the 1980s, and are now decidedly the weaker party.<br><br><button onclick='back1()'>Back</button></p></p></span>",

This has been a labor of a long period of light tinkering, and I appreciate all the feedback I got from the community - both positive and negative. I read every post and comment about the mod on the reddit and some on the discord, and have tried to adapt the mod to provide the best possible experience.<p><p>With this new version, you all will note a major retcon in the absence of the Democrats. I didn't like making this change as it was a bit part of what made this timeline distinct, but I felt it was necessary for both gameplay and realism reasons. Starting with realism - the 'southern breakaway party' as a political feature is a result of post-Civil War Southern identity and of suppression of the black population - neither of which would exist in a world where the North seceded and the African population was deported. <p><p> For gameplay, many noted the large PV-EC splits resulting from a quarter of the country being deep safe states, and this also made a Whig 'southern strategy' functionally impossible to make work well.<p><p>Second, I removed all the CYOA from the Lipinski side, including the 'hidden' McCaskill path. I did this because at the time, these were just my experiments to have fun with code, and I don't feel they fit the theme of the mod well. In addition, I didn't want to take the time to code 3 whole other 'replacement' paths as originally planned. <p><p> I hope you all won't mind these changes too much. Please feel free to post all your comments on the reddit post or send them directly to me at /u/neonhydroxide. There will be at least one more version of this mod before I call it 'done.' <p><p>For more information, please see:<p><p><a href='https://press.umich.edu/Books/F/Founding-Factions'>Founding Factions: How Majorities Shifted and Aligned to Shape the U.S. Constitution</a> by Jeremy Pope and Shawn Treier<p><p><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginaryelections/comments/u9iz6t/american_national_assembly_election_2014_the/'>American National Assembly Election, 2014 - the legacy of a Southern victory at the Constitutional Convention</a> by NeonHydroxide<p><img src='https://i.imgur.com/KeNG6wv.png' width='700px'></img><p><img src='https://i.imgur.com/u7JVtQs.png' width='700px'></img></div>",
