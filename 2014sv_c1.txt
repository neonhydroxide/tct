Lipinski calls you to concede relatively early in the night and wishes you the best.</p><p>With this mandate, you have the power to decide the direction of the party, though of course you will have to wrangle the old East Coast leadership who have rode your coattails to power. Already, you are looking at plans to reduce the deficit, tighten immigration enforcement, and send a major package of lethal aid to Prague.</p><p>Rest up over the next few days while you can - you will need all your strength to make it through the next five years.</p>",

With the election over, the Czechs have been left hanging, with Lipinski quietly dropping his limited support program even as the Germans advance on Plzen..</p><p>With your loss, the Whigs are left even more adrift. With both traditional and new Whig candidates failing to beat Lipinski's coalition, the party will have to do some serious soul-searching to find what comes next. Whatever it is, it won't be a repeat of your strategy, now proven to be a dead end.</p>",
